# Module-Specific AI Instructions

This module manages regulatory metadata fields.

Additional constraints:
- Deletions must always be confirmed using ActionDialog
- System fields are immutable except for visibility
- All user-facing strings must be localized (027x-localization is opted-in)

These instructions extend the canonical AI assistant instructions.
